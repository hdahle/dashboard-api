,Fossil fuel and cement production emissions by fuel type,,,,,,,
,"All values in million tonnes of carbon per year (MtC/yr), except the per capita emissions which are in tonnes of carbon per person per year (tC/person/yr). For values in million tonnes of CO2 per year, multiply the values below by 3.664",,,,,,,
,1MtC = 1 million tonne of carbon = 3.664 million tonnes of CO2,,,,,,,
,Methods: Full details of the method are described in Friedlingstein et al (2020).,,,,,,,
