,Fossil fuel and cement production emissions by fuel type,,,,,,,
,"All values in million tonnes of carbon per year (MtC/yr), except the per capita emissions which are in tonnes of carbon per person per year (tC/person/yr). For values in million tonnes of CO2 per year, multiply the values below by 3.664",,,,,,,
,1MtC = 1 million tonne of carbon = 3.664 million tonnes of CO2,,,,,,,
,Methods: Full details of the method are described in Friedlingstein et al (2022b) and Andrew and Peters (2021). Full country and fuel data can be found at https://zenodo.org/record/7215364#.Y1JIIHbRZmM,,,,,,,
,The uncertainty for the global estimates is about ±5 % for a ± 1 sigma confidence level. ,,,,,,,
