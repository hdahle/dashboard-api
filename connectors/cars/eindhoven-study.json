Electricity will become cleaner during the car's lifetime, 250g CO2e/kWh. Gasoline/diesel consumption is based on figures from spritmonitor.de and EPA. Emissions during fuel extraction/production is accounted for by addng 30% to tailpipe emissions. Emissions per litre: 3310g (diesel), 3140g (gasoline).",
