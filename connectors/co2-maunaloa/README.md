# CO2-Maunaloa
This folder contains three connectors:
1. co2-maunaloa.sh
2. co2-maunaloa-sm.sh
3. ch4-maulanoa.sh
The co2-maunaloa-sm.sh connector simply provides a subset of co2-maunaloa.sh, in order to reduce the amount of data read by the client. The data has been reduced from about 70 kbytes to 20kbytes.
