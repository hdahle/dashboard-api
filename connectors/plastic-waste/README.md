### To-do: Script to add JSON to Redis
There should be a shell script that updates Redis with the JSON data. THere is no need for adding anything to cron since this is static data.

````
# redis key is plastic-waste-2016
# data is in plastic-waste.json
redis-cli -x set plastic-waste-2016 < plastic-waste.json 

# verify that the data made it into redis
redis-cli get plastic-waste-2016

# pretty print the output
redis-cli get plastic-waste-2016 | jq .
